# TRSGPR-CPU 2022
The Relatively Simple General-Purpose Register CPU (or TRSGPR-CPU for short) is a university project with the goal of emulating a very simplified version of the GPR-CPU architecture, demonstrating the capabilities of handling two operand instructions. For simplicity's sake, there are features of the GPR-CPU that are not included or supported to simply demonstrate the focal point of this simulation, in which to demonstrate two operand instructions, in contrast to the presented RSCPU (single operand) and the stack-based architectures.
